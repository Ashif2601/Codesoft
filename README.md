# Codesoft
This repository contains a collection of Java-based mini projects developed as part of the CodeSoft Internship. The goal of these projects is to practice core Java concepts such as loops, conditionals, object-oriented programming (OOP), file handling, exception handling, Swing GUI development, and working with external APIs.
